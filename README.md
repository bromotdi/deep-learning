# Deep Learning Course

Deep learning is a popular methodology to train hierarchical machine learning models, such as neural networks. Over the last years, deep learning has produced breakthrough results in many different application areas. In this course, we study both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies for training multi-layer neural networks. Among other topics, we will discuss back-propagation, optimization, and generalization methods for supervised training, as well as CNN, LSTM, auto-encoders, transformers, and generative modeling with neural networks such as GAN and VAE. Finally, we will explore applications to language processing, computer vision, and speech processing.
